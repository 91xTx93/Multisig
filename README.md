This presentation serves as an introduction to the use cases, advantages, and disadvantages of multisignature wallets. The time allocated was limited to twenty minutes, which I believe is ideal for keeping the audience engaged. This timeframe helps prevent listeners from losing interest while ensuring those who are interested in the topic remain attentive.

The presentation was held at the Dublin Bitcoiners meetup in July 2025.
